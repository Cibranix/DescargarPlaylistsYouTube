# DescargarPlaylistsYouTube

Python notebook done in my free time to download a Youtube Playlist of music or videos for your long trips.

How to use it:
1. Search or create a playlist with the videos or music you want to download. (You have to make sure that the playlist is public or accessible via link).
2. Replace the sample url for the one you want.
3. Run the desired cell, the one for mp3 or the other for mp4.
4. Download the created zip and unzip in the desired folder of your pc or smartphone.

Although there are already plenty of alternatives that work very well, I am planning to improve this project by creating an API and a mobile application to make this system more efficient.
